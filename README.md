# Snake Game
## Description
This is a simple remake of the classic snake game I made for my first semester Java class as a final project. This game includes a board and a snake, there is a food item on the board for the snake to consume. The green Snake in this program moves around in various directions to eat the food. Each time the Snake eats the food, it grows in size by one increment, score increases in increments of 10, and another food item is spawned onto the board in a random area. The user can control the direction of the snake with the arrow keys, if the snakeâ€™s head touches itself or the wall, the snake dies and the game is over.
